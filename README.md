# FAQ-Based Chatbot


This project is an FAQ-based chatbot built using Python. The chatbot is designed to automatically respond to frequently asked questions, providing users with quick and accurate information. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user queries and match them with the most appropriate pre-defined answers.

## Features
- Automated Responses: Provides instant answers to common questions.
- Natural Language Processing: Understands and interprets user queries using NLP.
- Customizable Knowledge Base: Easily add or modify the set of FAQs and their corresponding responses.
- Context-Aware: Maintains conversation context to provide relevant responses based on previous interactions.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
## Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language for developing the chatbot.
- NLTK: A natural language processing library in Python for text processing and analysis.
- Flask: A lightweight web framework to deploy the chatbot as a web service.
- SQL: A database for storing FAQs and corresponding answers.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/faq-based-chatbot.git
cd faq-based-chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To run the chatbot locally, use the following command:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```
If you've set up the chatbot as a web service using Flask, you can start the server with:

```bash
python app.py
```
Once the server is running, you can interact with the chatbot through your web browser or terminal.

## Customization
- Adding FAQs: You can add new questions and answers to the chatbot's knowledge base by modifying the faq_data.json file (or the database if using SQL).
- Improving NLP: Enhance the chatbot's understanding by training it with additional data or by fine-tuning the NLP model.
